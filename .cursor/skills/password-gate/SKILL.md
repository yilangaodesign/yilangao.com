# Password Gate — Architecture Reference

> **Read this before modifying:** `src/proxy.ts`, `src/collections/Companies.ts`,
> `src/lib/company-session.ts`, `src/lib/company-data.ts`, or any file under `src/app/(frontend)/for/`.

## System Overview

The main site is behind a server-side password gate. All unauthenticated requests
are intercepted by `src/proxy.ts` and redirected to `/for/welcome` (or `/for/[company]`
if the visitor has a company-specific URL).

**This is a security boundary.** Incorrect changes can expose the site publicly or
lock out all visitors (including the Payload CMS admin if `/admin` is accidentally gated).

## Data Storage

Company data lives in the **Payload CMS `companies` collection** (Supabase Postgres).
This replaced the earlier static `src/config/companies.json` file.

The collection is managed via:
- **Payload default list/edit UI** at `/admin/collections/companies`
- **Custom dashboard** at `/admin/companies-dashboard` — table with quick actions (toggle active, copy URL+password, auto-generate password, delete)

## Data Flow

```
1. Visitor → GET /for/google
2. proxy.ts → /for/* allowed through
3. Login page renders → fetches company from Payload DB → applies theme
4. Visitor → POST password via server action
5. Server action validates password against DB (constant-time comparison)
6. If valid → set portfolio_session cookie (HMAC-signed, company=google)
7. Server action → increment loginCount + update lastLoginAt in DB
8. Redirect to /
9. proxy.ts → reads cookie, verifies HMAC, sets x-company header
   (proxy does NOT query DB — cookie-only validation, Option A)
10. Page renders → case study reads session → fetches company from DB → renders callout
```

### Adding a New Company

1. Go to `/admin/companies-dashboard` or `/admin/collections/companies`
2. Click "Add Company" — fill in name, slug, password, accent, greeting
3. Add case study notes (projectSlug must match Projects collection slugs)
4. The company is immediately available — no build or restart needed

## Session Cookie

- **Name:** `portfolio_session`
- **Value:** `{company_slug}.{hmac_base64url}` (signed with `SESSION_SECRET`)
- **Attributes:** HTTP-only, Secure (production), SameSite=Lax, 30-day expiry, path=/
- **Verification:** `verifySessionValue()` in `company-session.ts` — constant-time HMAC comparison
- **Secret:** `SESSION_SECRET` env var (falls back to `PAYLOAD_SECRET`, then `dev-secret-change-me`)

## Proxy Allowlist

The proxy allows these paths through without a session cookie:

| Path Pattern | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| `/for/*` | Login pages |
| `/admin/*` | Payload CMS admin (has its own auth) |
| `/api/*` | Payload CMS API routes |
| `/_next/*` | Next.js static assets and internals |
| `/images/*`, `/media/*` | Static media files |
| `/favicon.ico`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml` | Metadata files |

**Everything else requires a valid session cookie.**

## Proxy ↔ Database Architecture

The proxy uses **cookie-only validation** (Option A from the architecture plan):
- The proxy only verifies the HMAC signature on the cookie — it never queries the database
- If a company is deactivated, new logins are refused (the server action checks `active`)
- Existing sessions expire naturally (30 days)
- For immediate session revocation, change `SESSION_SECRET` (nuclear option) or implement a blocklist (Phase 2)

This approach keeps the proxy fast and free of database dependencies.

## Dev Preview Mode

In development (`NODE_ENV === "development"`), appending `?preview=true` to any login
page URL bypasses the session redirect. This lets authenticated users view and iterate
on the login UI without clearing cookies.

- Generic: `http://localhost:4000/for/welcome?preview=true`
- Company-themed: `http://localhost:4000/for/{slug}?preview=true`

The bypass is implemented in `src/app/(frontend)/for/[company]/page.tsx` — the server
component checks `searchParams.preview` and skips `getCompanyFromSession()` when true.
This has no effect in production (`NODE_ENV === "production"`).

## Login Page Theming

The login page at `/for/[company]` is styled with a CSS custom property `--accent-color`
set from the company's `accent` field. This drives the input focus ring, submit button
background, and accent bar color.

If the company slug doesn't match any DB entry (or the company is inactive), the page
falls back to a generic unbranded login with a neutral gray accent.

### Phase 2: Layout Variants

The `layoutVariant` field supports future expansion:
- `centered` (current) — card centered on page
- `split` (future) — two-column layout with company branding on one side
- `fullbleed` (future) — full-screen background with overlay login

The login page will select a React layout component based on this field.

## Case Study Notes

When a visitor with a company session views `/work/[slug]`:

1. `page.tsx` reads the company slug from the session cookie
2. Fetches the company record from Payload DB via `getCompanyBySlug()`
3. Searches `caseStudyNotes` array for a matching `projectSlug`
4. If found, passes `{ companyName, note }` to `ProjectClient`
5. `ProjectClient` renders an aside with "Why this matters to [Company]" heading

The callout renders between the project description and the first content section.

## Management Dashboard

Custom Payload admin view at `/admin/companies-dashboard`. Features:

- Company table with name, slug, status, last login, login count
- Quick activate/deactivate toggle (single click)
- Auto-generate password button (`{slug}-preview-{year}` pattern)
- Copy URL + password to clipboard (formatted text)
- Full CRUD (add/edit/delete with confirmation)
- Accent color swatch per company

Accessible via the "Company Access" link in the admin sidebar navigation.

## Future AI Extension

The plan supports live AI generation of case study notes. To implement:

1. Add an `aiNotes: true` flag to the company collection schema
2. Create an API route that generates notes per company/slug pair using AI
3. Cache the generated notes (avoid re-generating on every page load)
4. In the case study page: if no matching `caseStudyNotes` entry exists but `aiNotes` is
   enabled, call the API route instead
5. The `companyNote` prop on `ProjectClient` doesn't change — it receives the same
   `{ companyName, note }` regardless of whether the note is static or AI-generated

## Testing Protocol

After any change to the password gate system:

1. **Clear cookies** for the site domain
2. **Visit `/`** — should redirect to `/for/welcome`
3. **Visit `/for/google`** — should show themed login page with Google accent color
4. **Enter wrong password** — should show error, not redirect
5. **Enter correct password** — should redirect to `/`, site should render normally
6. **Visit a case study** — if the company has a matching note, the callout should appear
7. **Check `/admin`** — should NOT require a password (Payload's own auth applies)
8. **Check `/admin/companies-dashboard`** — should show the management dashboard

For UI iteration on the login page without clearing cookies, use `?preview=true`
(dev only): `http://localhost:4000/for/welcome?preview=true`

## Env Vars

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Recommended | Falls back to `PAYLOAD_SECRET` | Signs session cookies |
| `SITE_PASSWORD` | Optional | `glad you are here` | Universal fallback password for all login pages (company and generic) |

Both must be set in the Vercel dashboard for the `yilangao-portfolio` project.

**Undeletable fallback:** The phrase "glad you are here" is hardcoded in `actions.ts`
as always-valid, independent of the `SITE_PASSWORD` env var. Changing `SITE_PASSWORD`
in production adds a new valid password but does NOT revoke "glad you are here". This
is intentional for stale-resume recovery and should never be rotated.

**Invariant: `welcome` must never have a CMS record.** If a `companies` row with slug
`welcome` existed, `getCompanyBySlug("welcome")` would return data and personalized
notes could leak to generic visitors. The home page guards against this
(`companySlug !== "welcome"`), and `work/[slug]/page.tsx` also guards against it,
but the invariant remains the primary defense.

## Password Normalization

`comparePasswords()` in `company-session.ts` normalizes both the user input and stored
password before comparison. This is a UX decision: the password completes a visible
greeting sentence ("Welcome, ___"), so matching should be as forgiving as a human
reading it would be.

Normalization steps (order matters):
1. Lowercase
2. Expand common contractions (`you're` -> `you are`, `we're` -> `we are`, etc.)
3. Strip remaining apostrophes and smart quotes
4. Strip all spaces, dashes, and underscores

This means `glad you are here`, `Glad You Are Here`, `glad-you-are-here`,
`gladyouarehere`, and `glad you're here` all match. Abbreviations (`glad u are here`)
and different words (`happy you are here`) do not.

Normalization applies to ALL passwords (generic and per-company). Per-company passwords
set in the CMS are also normalized at comparison time.

## Cross-App Consideration

The playground's `turbopack.root` is set to the monorepo root so `@ds/*` imports
resolve correctly. This causes Next.js 16 to detect file conventions (like `proxy.ts`)
from the monorepo root, not just from `playground/`. A no-op `playground/src/proxy.ts`
shadows the main site's proxy to prevent the collision. See EAP-061.

If you rename or move `src/proxy.ts`, verify the playground build still passes.
